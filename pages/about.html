        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>From a young age, cars have always been more than just a mode of transportation to me—they're a passion,
         a lifestyle, and a canvas for creativity. My name is John O'Reilly, and I'm a lifelong car enthusiast
          with a collection that spans decades, styles, and innovations in automotive history. Whether it’s the roar 
          of an engine or the sleek design of a classic model, my love for cars has driven me to build a collection 
          that reflects both the beauty and the power of these machines.
        </p>

    <div class="about">
        <h2>My Collection</h2>
        <p>Over the years, my collection has grown to include a wide range of vehicles—from classic American muscle cars
           to modern European sports cars, each with its own story and unique appeal. My garage isn’t just a place to store
           cars; it’s a celebration of automotive artistry. Some cars are fully restored to their original glory, while others
            are customized to reflect my personal taste and vision. No matter the make or model, each car in my collection holds
             a special place in my heart</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about">
        <h2>My Passion</h2>
        <p>For me, cars are more than just machines—they're works of art, symbols of freedom, and an expression of human ingenuity. 
            What excites me most about cars is not just their performance, but the craftsmanship behind each vehicle. From the design 
            of a vintage dashboard to the precision of a modern engine, every detail tells a story. Over the years, I've spent countless
             hours on the road, at car shows, and in my workshop, always seeking to learn more and connect with others who share this same passion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about">
        <h2>My Vision</h2>
        <p>Looking ahead, my vision for this collection is ever-evolving. I’m always on the hunt for new additions that tell a story—whether it’s a 
            barn find in need of restoration or a high-performance vehicle fresh off the assembly line. My goal is not only to expand the collection 
            but to showcase the rich history and innovation behind each car. In the future, I hope to continue participating in more car shows and perhaps
             even organize events to share these incredible machines with other enthusiasts</p>
